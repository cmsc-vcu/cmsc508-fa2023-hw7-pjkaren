# Homework 7 - CMSC508 - Fall 2023

This project creates a resume database for a software company's employees. The student will create various tables within a SQL database and populate the tables with sample data. The structure of the database will be outlined in an accompanying .qmd file, along with sample queries that test the database.

The setup of the database is executed in the hw7-ddl.sql file.

## Homework tasks

The following steps were followed to ensure proper setup for the assignment.

1. Download the repo as usual.  Open your command line and move to the repo.  Run poetry install and poetry shell.
2. I provide scaffold files for both your QMD and your DDL.SQL files. 
3. Render the QMD. The scaffold will trap errors better making the entire experience a bit less in-your-face.  View the HTML file and scan the entire document. 
4. Add appropriate key-value pairs to your .env file and re-render your QMD.
5. Open VS code to the repo.
6. Create a new DB connection to the 23FA_users_  folder.
7. Run the DDL file against the new database connection.  Your screen should remain blank.
8. Rerender the QMD file.  The error should be gone.
9. Scan the QMD file and see whatâ€™s happening inside.  Once you get everything running and connected, your job is to complete the DDL file and the QMD report.
