## Overview and description

The database designed for your company encapsulates a comprehensive repository of collective skills, certifications, and employee information. It serves as a central hub to manage and identify the skills possessed by individuals, aiding in finding specific skill sets among employees and highlighting skill gaps in particular roles. The database segments information into three main tables: one for skills and certifications, encompassing IDs, names, descriptions, and URLs; another for employees, housing details like employee IDs, names, contact information, LinkedIn profiles, bios, and join dates; and a third for roles, with role IDs, names, and sort IDs for reporting purposes. The database facilitates the association of skills/certifications with employees, allowing multiple skills per employee and tracking acquisition dates, including expected future skill acquisition. Additionally, it maps employees to roles, enabling employees to take on multiple roles and tracking their assignment dates, providing a comprehensive framework to aid your esteemed sensei in enhancing the company's capabilities and propelling its growth.

## Examples of data in the database

For the people, skills, and roles tables, provide a description of each table and it's contents. Then provide a listing of the entire table.

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from skills;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from roles;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```


## Sample queries

Let's explore the database!

# List skill names, tags, and descriptions ordered by name

(here a sample query)

```{python}
sql = f"""
select * from people
"""
```


(and here is a sample result from the query)

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df

```


### List people names and email addresses ordered by last_name


### List skill names of Person 1


### List people names with Skill 6


### List people with a DEVELOPER role


### List names and email addresses of people without skills


### List names and tags of unused skills


### List people names and skill names with the BOSS role


### List ids and names of unused roles


## Reflection

(Write a paragraph expressing your thoughts, feelings, and insights about your experience with this assignment.  Pause and breath before writing - I'm trying to encourage critical thinking and self-awareness while allowing you to explore the connections between theory and practice. And yes, delete this paragraph.)
